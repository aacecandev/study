Refusing to give up a strongly held belief can prevent someone from being persuaded, as Jessica says in the lecture. Sometimes those strongly held beliefs are false or unjustified, but sometimes they are true and justified. In either case, these people are not persuaded, because persuasion requires a change in belief.

Can any argument persuade every person in the world?

Yes

No
Correcto

Every argument has to be formulated in some language, but there will always be someone in the world who does not speak that language or understand that argument, so they cannot be persuaded by it. Babies are also people who cannot be persuaded by arguments, at least if they do not yet speak any language.
