Pregunta 3

All arguments are made up of (or expressed in) language
1 / 1 punto

True

False
Correcto

Answer: True.

Premises are sentences, statements, or propositions. Sentences and statements are made up of language, and propositions are expressed by language. Notice that no particular language is required, so it would be false to say that all arguments are in English.

Pregunta 4

Every argument is intended to establish a conclusion that the audience did not believe before.
1 / 1 punto

True

False
Correcto

Answer: False.

Sometimes the conclusion is already both believed and established as true, and the point of the argument is only to explain WHY it is true. Hence, Monty Python is not always right.

True

False
Correcto

Answer: False.

Although people who give arguments always intend to give some kind of reason, they often fail to fulfill that intention. Bad arguments fail to give good reasons.

Pregunta 6

Megafauna:  n. very large animals. 
1 / 1 punto

Yes, this is an argument.

No, this is not an argument.
Correcto

Answer: No, this is not an argument.

The defined term is not a full sentence, statement, or proposition, so it cannot be a conclusion. The definition is not a reason for the term that is defined.

Pregunta 7

Reptiles include turtles, alligators, crocodiles, snakes, lizards, and the tuatara.
1 / 1 punto

Yes, this is an argument.

No, this is not an argument
Correcto

Answer: No, this is not an argument.

One word in a list does not give a reason for the other words. One could argue, “This is a turtle, so it is a reptile,” but the list by itself does not explicitly state that argument or any argument.

Pregunta 8

World War II occurred after World War I occurred.
1 / 1 punto

Yes, this is an argument.

No, this is not an argument.
Correcto

Answer: No, this is not an argument.

This sentence is about historical or chronological order rather than rational order. It does not explicitly claim that World War I gives a reason for World War II.

Pregunta 9

World War II occurred because World War I occurred.
0 / 1 punto

Yes, this is an argument.

No, this is not an argument.
Incorrecto

Answer: Yes, this is an argument.

The word “because” makes this sentence claim that World War I gives a reason why World War II occurred. The premise is "World War I occurred," and the conclusion is "World War II occurred."

Pregunta 10

The sides of this right triangle are 1 meter long, so its hypotenuse is 2 meters long.
0 / 1 punto

Yes, this is an argument.

No, this is not an argument.
Incorrecto

Answer: Yes, this is an argument.

The word “so” indicates that the first sentence is supposed to be a reason for the second sentence. This argument is very bad, since the hypotenuse must be square root of 2 meters long instead of 2 meters long. But bad arguments are still arguments.
