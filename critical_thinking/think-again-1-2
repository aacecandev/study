Incorrecto

Answer: False.

To justify a conclusion is to give a reason for that conclusion, but the audience might not understand or accept that reason, even when it is a good reason. Then the argument might have no effect (or an unintended effect) on the audience. One can give a reason for a conclusion, and it will be a reason, regardless of the effect on the audience.
