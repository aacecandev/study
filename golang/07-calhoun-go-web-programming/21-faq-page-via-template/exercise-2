This lesson consists of two optional exercises intended to help you learn a bit more about Chi.

## Ex1 - Add a URL Parameter

Read the docs and see if you can add a URL parameter to one of your routes, retrieve it in your handler, and output it to the resulting HTML.

For example, imagine that we wanted to add support for a path used to show individual galleries. We might use the path /galleries/<id-here>. See if you can create a handle that retrieves the id from the URL using Chi, and setup the Chi router to direct requests to the correct handler.

*Hint: See [these docs](https://github.com/go-chi/chi#url-parameters) if you need some guidance. You shouldn't need to use context, just the URLParam method.
Ex2 - Experiment with Chi's builtin middleware

Chi provides quite a few builtin middleware. One is the Logger middleware, which will track how long each request is taking. Try to add it to your application, then to only a single route.

What other types of uses could you imagine middleware serving in an application?
